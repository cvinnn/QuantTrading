## Abstract
We consider the effectiveness of trailing stop-loss rules which, unlike traditional stop-loss rules,
involve the sell trigger price being moved higher to protect profits as prices rise. Our results
indicate that while these rules have inferior mean returns to a simple buy-and-hold strategy,
they do a good job of stopping losses. They generate superior risk-adjusted returns for investors
with normal levels of risk aversion and perform  particularly well at reducing downside risk.
These  results  hold  in  all  U.S.  stocks  and  are  particular  strong  for  stocks  that  end  up  being
delisted.

## 1. Introduction
Stop-loss  rules,  which  involve  selling  a  security  when  its  price  drops  to  a  pre-
determined threshold and buying the security back when its price rises a pre-specified amount,
are widely used in financial markets (Han, Zhou and Zhu, 2016). However, research into their
effectiveness has generated mixed results. For instance, Lo and Remorov (2017) find stop-loss
strategies only add value in certain circumstances and that risk reduction is often not substantial.
There are two types of these rules - traditional and trailing stop. Traditional stop-loss
rules are either price based or time based. Price based traditional rules involve selling when the
price falls a certain percentage below the purchase price, irrespective of the price path since
the  purchase  price,  while  time  based  rules  involve  selling  if  the  price  moves a  certain
percentage below the entry price within a specified time interval. Trailing stop-loss rules, in
contrast, are more dynamic in that the sell trigger price is adjusted upwards if the price moves
higher following a purchase. A position is then closed if the price subsequently declines a given
percentage below the new high price. These rules are therefore designed to protect profits.
## 1
## The
purpose of this paper is determining the extent to which trailing stop-loss (hereafter TSL) rules
can protect against losses.
TSL rules appear to be more popular than traditional stop-loss rules in industry. Loton
(2009)  notes that  a trailing  stop-loss  sell  order  is  often  used  by  trend  following  investors  to
avoid the reversal of an upward trend. Wilcox and Crittenden (2009) show trailing stop-loss
rules work as an exit method and can earn an abnormal return in trading the S&P 500 index.
Clarke and Clarke (2011), Magliolo (2013) and Toit (2015) suggest that trailing stop-loss rules
outperform traditional stop-loss  rules because  trailing  stops better protect the  gained  profits
due  to the  stop  price  moving  up as  the price increases. Several  academic  papers  discuss
theoretical aspects of stop loss rules. Glynn and Iglehart (1995) use discrete time random walk

and continuous time Brownian motion models with positive drift to document characteristics
of trades using the trailing stop strategy and also address the question of optimizing the distance
from  the  current  price  to  the  stop. Abramov,  Khan  and  Khan  (2008)  provide  models  for
characteristics of trailing stop strategies such as the average duration and duration variation of
open positions. Fu and  Zhang (2012) suggest trailing stop-loss rules are unlikely to perform
well for stocks that have return paths consistent with Geometric Brownian motion.
It is possible that one of the factors behind the popularity of trailing stop loss rules is
the focus of investors on percentage price declines from high points. Many commentators refer
to a “correction” as having occurred when price declines 10% from its recent high.
## 2
## While
traditional stop loss rules are not referenced against recent high prices and declines from these
levels, trailing stop loss rules are. They are therefore consistent with the media attention around
percentage price declines from recent high prices. The tight trailing stop-loss rules with a stop-
loss threshold less than 10% is thus a mechanism that can be used to avoid corrections.
We investigate the performance of trailing stop-loss rules compared to a simple buy-
and-hold (hereafter BH) approach  in U.S.  stocks over  the  1926-2016  period. Bessembinder
(2018) notes that delisting returns can have an important impact on equity returns over time,
and it is possible that stop-loss rules are particularly effective at avoiding large losses on stocks
that delist, so we include these returns in our analysis.
Our results, which are based on a TSL thresholds ranking from 1-20% indicate that a
simple  buy-and-hold approach  generates  larger returns than TSL rules. The  level  of  risk,  as
measured by the standard deviation of returns is lower for TSL rules, but the lower mean return
more than offsets this leading to a lower Sharpe Ratio for these rules. However, the value of
TSL rules becomes clear when utility analysis results are considered. Each TSL rule generates

For instance, Sheetz (2018) notes “The Nasdaq Composite Index on Thursday became the first major U.S. stock
market  benchmark  to  dip  into  a  correction,  dragged  down  by  losses  across  all  the  major  technology-related
companies. A correction on Wall Street is defined as down more than 10 percent from its high.”

larger  utility  than  the BH approach  for  risk-aversion  coefficients  of  one,  three,  and  five.
Measures of downside risk further highlight the benefits of TSL rules. Both VaRs and Expected
Shortfall  measures  reveals  materially  less  downside  risk  from  the TSL rules  than  the BH
approach.  Our  results  hold  across  all  stocks,  but  are  particularly  strong  among  the  group  of
stocks  that  end  up delisting. TSL rules have  become  more  effective  through  time.  They  add
more value in declining markets and perform the best on stocks that are more volatile and liquid,
and with a lower book-to-market ratio.
We contribute several strands of the literature. First, we add to the stop-loss literature
which  has  reported  mixed  results  regarding  their  effectiveness. Kaminski  and  Lo  (2014)
suggest that time based traditional stop-loss rules underperform under random walk and mean-
reversion markets  but outperform under  momentum  and  regime-switching  models. Lo  and
Remerov (2017) consider various aspects of the downside risks of time-based traditional stop-
loss rules. They find no evidence of consistent performance but do document a positive relation
between the extent of return serial  correlation and the performance of these rules. However,
Fischbacher,  Hoffmann and Schudy (2017) find price  based traditional stop-loss  rules can
reduce the impact of the disposition effect and decrease the realized losses. A number of papers
have also studied various aspects of TSL rules. Using traditional risk metrics Lei and Li (2009)
find that TSL rules neither increase or reduce the losses experienced by investors relative to a
buy and hold strategy. Clare, Seaton, Smith, and Thomas (2013) show TSL rules do not add
value  to trend  following  rules.  However, Snorrason and  Yusupov  (2009)  find TSL rules
outperform a buy-and-hold strategy in Sweden markets.
Second, we contribute to a broader strand of the literature that highlights the importance
and  implications  of  path  of  returns  in  additional  to  the  average  return. Shleifer and Vishny
(1997) point out that asset managers who manage capital on behalf of outside investors often
avoid volatile arbitrage opportunities due to the risk that their investors will request that their

capital be returned during periods of drawdown.  Moreover, researchers such as Barroso and
Santa-Clara (2015) and Daniel and Moskowitz (2016) consider the price path of the popular
momentum strategy and highlight that while the overall average returns are positive there can
be periods  where large losses are incurred. TSLs are specifically  designed to limit downside
risk and prevent periods of large losses.
The rest of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 contains a description of the data
and trading  rules. The  results  are  presented  and  discussed  in Section  3,  while  Section  4
concludes the paper.

- Data and trading rules
## 2.1 Data
We study all common stocks from CRSP database. 25,997 common stocks are selected
including share codes of 10, 11 and 12 in the US markets from 1 July 1926 to 30 December
## 2016.

Bessembinder (2018) highlights the importance of considering delisting returns so we
follow his approach and include these in our analysis. To include the effect of delisting return,
we compound the two returns if both regular return in the last trading day and delisting return
are available.
## 4
We ignore the impact of delisting returns for stocks that have missing delisting
returns from the CRSP database.
## 5



## 3
All missing returns are deleted.
## 4
Some stocks have the missing return, which is deleted at the beginning, in the last trading day. We compound
the delisting return to the last existing return for these stocks.
## 5
The definitions of missing delisting codes are divided into four types. -55: “CRSP has no sources to establish a
value after delisting or is unable to assign a value to one or more known distributions after delisting”. -66: “more
than 10 trading periods between a security's last price and its first available price on a new exchange”. -88: “the
stock is still active”. -99: “security trades on a new exchange after delisting, but CRSP currently has no sources
to gather price information”.

2.2 Description of the rules
We compare two approaches to investing in each stock. A simple BH approach and TSL
rules. Both approaches are established at the start of each stock’s data series. The BH approach
involves buying and holding the stock for the entire period. The TSL approach involves selling
the stock when it declines X% from its high price and only buying it back when it increases X%
above its low price. The initial trailing stop loss trigger price (TSLTP) is set at X% below the
price the stock is purchased at. If the stock price does not increase the TSLTP remains at this
initial level. However, if the stock price increases beyond the initial purchase price the TSLTP
is increased so that it is X% below each new high price. When the price falls below the TSLTP
a sell signal is generated. Lo and Remorov (2017) note traditional stop-loss rules with one day
delay in the transaction can increase the performance as it captures the reversed returns in the
day after the trigger. It is also a more practical way for investors to close the position on the
day  following the  trigger.  We  consider to  exit  the  position on  the  day  following  the TSLTP
being hit (regardless of the price movement on that day). A position in T-bills is entered at the
end of the day on the day the stock is sold.
The T-bills position is maintained until the stock price rises above the buy trigger price
(BTP), which is initially set at X% above the closing price on the day the previous long position
was exited. As with the TSLTP, the BTP decreases each day if the price falls below the price
the long price was exited. Equation (1) shows the position of TSL approach mathematically:

different with  the  Lo  and  Remerov  (2017).  They  make  the  trading  decision  in  a  time  based
traditional stop-loss rules. However, we compare the historical highest price with the current
price no matter how long is taken since the buy price.
We name the stock return as BH return in the BH approach. The return is named TSL
return  in the TSL approach.  The TSL return  equal  to  either  stock  return  or  T-bills  rate that
depending on the long position in either the stock or T-bills in the trading day. Equation (2)

## 3. Results
3.1 Core results
Table  1 contains  monthly  returns,  Sharpe  ratios, utility  analysis,  and  downside  risk
measures for the BH approach and the TSL strategy with the four thresholds of 1%, 5%, 10%,
and 20%. The Panel A results indicate that mean returns are lower for each of the TSL strategies
than the BH approach. TSL rules clearly do not add value when considered solely on the basis
of mean returns. Risk, as measured by return standard deviation, is lower for each of the TSL
rules than the BH approach, but the risk reduction is not sufficient to offset the lower returns,
which results in lower Sharpe Ratios for the TSL rule than the BH approach.
In Panel B we follow Rapach, Ringgenberg and Zhou (2016) and report the Certainty
Equivalent Return (CER). The equation is shown as below:

## 퐶퐸푅=푟−0.5훾휎

## (3)

where the  γ is the risk aversion level. r and  휎 is the mean and standard deviation of monthly
returns. The  results  indicate  that  each  of  the TSL rules  generate  a  higher  CER  than  the BH
approach. This applies to each risk aversion level, with the results indicating that the TSL rules
out-perform the BH rule from a CER perspective when γ rises above 0.5.
The results in Panel C compare the TSL rules to the BH approach from a downside risk
perspective. We report the Value-at-Risk (VaR) by calculating either 1 or 5 percentile in pooled
monthly returns. The VaR indicates a potential loss level that can be reached by either the TSL
or BH approach under a certain confidence level. The Expected Shortfall (ES) is the mean of
monthly  returns  that  are  less  than  the  respective  VaR. The  ES  shows  an expected  loss  to  be
achieved once the VaR is breached under the confidence level.  The Panel C results indicate
that each of the TSL rules has both the higher VaR and ES than the BH approach. The results
hold across two confidence levels. The outperformance of TSL rules over the BH approach is
even better when applying a tighter confidence level, such as 1%.

[Insert Table 1 About Here]

Table  2  has  the monthly  returns,  Sharpe  ratios, utility  analysis,  and  downside  risk
measures for  active  stocks  under  the BH approach  and  the TSL strategy  with  the  same
thresholds to Table 1. The Panel A results show that mean returns are inferior for each of the
TSL rules than the BH approach. TSL approaches underperform to the BH approach for active
stocks from a perspective of monthly returns. The lower standard deviation of TSL rules than
that of the BH approach indicates the success in risk reduction of TSL rules for active stocks.
However,  the  reduction  in  risk is  not  enough to  generate  the  higher  Sharpe  ratios  than BH
approach for active stocks.

Panel  B  indicates TSL approaches  have  higher  CER  than  the BH rule  except  when γ
equals to 1. Is shows TSL approaches perform better than the BH rule for investors with a γ
that greater than 1.4 concerning active stocks.
Panel C shows  the two downside measures of TSL and BH rules  for  active  stocks
concerning two confidence levels. TSL approaches have the higher VaR and ES than those of
the BH approach. The downside measures of both TSL and BH approaches is increased, which
means the less downside risks compared to the Panel C results in Table 1. This is attributed to
the  relatively  better  overall  performance  of  active  stocks. TSL approaches still generate
significantly less downside risk than the BH approach.

[Insert Table 2 About Here]

Table 3 has the series of core results for delisted stocks under the BH approach and the
TSL rules with the four thresholds of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20%. The Panel A results show that
each mean return of the TSL rules are greater than the BH approach. TSL approaches perform
better  than  the BH approach  for  delisted  stocks  from  a  perspective  of  monthly  returns.  The
standard deviation of TSL rules is also lower than that of the BH approach, which indicates the
less  risk  of  each TSL rule  than  the BH strategy  for  delisted  stocks.  Further,  the  superior  in
monthly returns and the risk reduction add value to generate the higher Sharpe ratios of TSL
rules than BH approach for delisted stocks.
Panel B indicates that each of TSL approaches have higher CER than the BH rule. All
the negative CERs imply that the delisted stocks cannot bring the positive utility for risk averse
investors. However, TSL approaches out-perform the BH rule for investors with a positive γ for
delisted stocks from a CER perspective. The Panel C results show the downside measures of
TSL and BH rules  by  looking  at  VaR  and  ES  for  delisted  stocks  concerning  two  confidence

## 11

levels. TSL approaches  have  the  higher  VaR  and  ES  than  those  of  the BH approach.  The
downside measures of both approaches are less than those in Panel C results in Table 1 and
Table 2 that indicate delisted stocks are more risky than other stocks. TSL approaches add value
to reduce the downside risks, compared to the BH rule.

[Insert Table 3 About Here]

3.2 Time-series determinants
In  this  section,  we  consider  the  performance  of TSL rules  though  time.  We  focus  on
downside risk as it seems reasonable to assume that stop-loss rules were developed to “stop
losses” rather than minimise risk measures such as volatility. We select CER with a γ of 3 as a
proxy  of  the  risk-adjusted  performance, both VaR  and  ES are at  1%  level as  downside
exposures. We  firstly  calculate  the  cross-sectional  mean  of  these  variables  in  each  month  to
indicate  the  performance  of  either TSL or BH rules  over  time.  Then  we use  three pooled
regressions  that refer  to different time-series groups,  which  are  sub-periods,  business  cycles
and  market  states, to examine the performance  of  CER  and reductions  in downside  risk  for
each of the TSL approaches in excess to the BH approach in a time-series aspect.
All results are displayed in percent.

3.2.1 Sub-period analysis
We investigate the  changing  CER of TSL approach and  its  effectiveness at reducing
downside risks over  time by  four  sub-periods  as  shown in  equations  below. In  Table  4,  our
results show the increasing excess performance of TSL approaches over the BH rule regarding
CER and downside risks reduction over time.

[Insert Table 4 About Here]

Panel A shows the TSL approaches have a significant higher CER than the BH approach
in the recent sub-periods, compared with earlier sub-periods. TSL rules generate increasingly
more  risk-adjusted  performance  than  the BH strategy  for  investors  with  a γ of  3  over  time.
Results  in  Panel  B  and  Panel  C  indicate  that TSL approaches are increasingly  effective in
cutting more downside risks than the BH approach in the more recent sub-periods. However,
TSL rules  experience  more  downside  risks than  the BH approach from  1926  to  1948 when
applying  the  threshold  of  1%  or  5%. The  outperformance  at  reducing  downside  risks  is
extremely stronger when the 10% threshold is applied. Our results show TSL approaches have
an increasing trend in enhancing risk-adjusted performance and reducing downside risks over
time.

3.2.2 Business cycles analysis
We  study  the  difference in CER  and downside risk reduction between TSL and BH
approaches during expansions and recessions determined by NBER. The results are displayed
in  Table  5. Our  results  show the CER  of TSL approach in  excess  of BH approach is  higher

during recessions. However, there is no evidence showing the TSL approach can significantly
reduce the downside risks during recessions. The equations is estimated as below:

[Insert Table 5 About Here]

In Table 5, the constant is significantly positive across three panels that show the TSL
approach has the outperformance in excess of the BH approach during expansions regarding
both  CER  and  downside  measures. The  similar  constants  in  each   panel  indicate  the
outperformance during expansions is not related to the chosen thresholds. Further, the results
in Panel A show the coefficient of recessions is positive. It suggests the TSL approaches have
even higher CER than the BH approach during recessions for investors with a risk reversion
level of 3. However, in Panel B and C, the coefficient of recessions is insignificant that implies
the effectiveness of TSL approach in controlling downside risks is not significantly affected by
NBER business cycles.

3.2.3 Market states analysis
In this section, we study the difference of CER and downside measures between TSL
and BH approaches during different market states. Following Cooper, Gutierrez Jr and Hameed
(2004), we construct UP market and DOWN market as two market states. We use the CRSP
value-weighted index to determine the UP or DOWN markets. The market is UP if the mean

return is non-negative in a calendar month. Otherwise, we deem the market as DOWN in that
calendar month.
The results of three equations below are shown in Table 6. Our results suggest the TSL
approaches have particularly higher CER and downside exposures than the BH approach during
DOWN  markets.  This  implies  the TSL approach  performs  better than  the BH rule during
DOWN markets.

[Insert Table 6 About Here]

The results in Panel A indicate the significantly negative constant when four thresholds
are applied, respectively. The negative constant shows TSL approach has the lower CER than
the BH approach  during  UP  markets.  However,  the  coefficient  of  DOWN  markets  are
significantly  positive,  which  means  the TSL approach  is  preferred  by  investors  with  a  risk
reversion level of 3 during DOWN markets instead of during UP markets.
In  Panel  B  and  C, our results  show the positive  constant as  well  as the  positive
coefficient of the DOWN markets when applying four thresholds, respectively. It suggests the
TSL approach reduces more downside risks in excess of the BH approach during UP markets.
TSL rules have even less  downside  exposures  than  the BH strategy  during DOWN  markets.
This supports the Lo and Remorov (2017) that suggest the time based traditional stop-loss rules
have   the better   performance   than   the   buy-and-hold   strategy   when   returns   have   the
characteristics of relatively higher autocorrelation. The DOWN markets have negative mean

daily returns, which include the serial correlation among returns. Overall, our results show the
TSL approach  helps  investors  to  reduce  the  downside  exposure  especially during  DOWN
markets.

3.3 Cross-sectional determinants
In this section, we compare and contrast a series of cross-sectional factors that have the
impact on the effectiveness of TSL and BH approaches at reducing downside risks.
We investigate six cross-sectional factors, which are size, B/M ratio, liquidity, volume,
price, and volatility. Size is the monthly average market value of each stock. They are displayed
in units of 1 million. We use the annual common equity, which is obtained from COMPUSTAT,
in the previous year divided by the market value in the current month as the monthly B/M ratio.
The B/M ratio regression is restricted between 1980 and 2016 as the common equity ratio is
only available during that time. For the liquidity, we follow Karolyi, Lee and Van Dijk (2012)
to take the natural log of Amihud ratio as indicated in the equation below:

## ≡−log (1+

where the 푅

are the return, price, and trading volume of stock 푖 in day 푡. We
calculate the average of the daily log Amihud ratio that multiplies by -1 in each month as the
liquidity measure. For volume and price, we calculate the average of them in each month. The
volume is reported in units of 1000. The volatility is measured by taking the standard deviation
of  daily  returns  in  each  month.  All  independent  variables  are  displayed  in  their natural
logarithm.

We investigate   the   impact   of   cross-sectional   characteristics on   the downside
performance between TSL and BH approaches by Fama-Macbeth regressions. We focus on the
1% VaR and ES between TSL and BH rules in this section. We display the results of regressions
refer  to  VaR in  Table  7  and  the  results regarding  ES  in  Table  8. All  results are  reported  in
percent.
Our  results  show  the TSL approach  is  more  effective  at  reducing  downside  risks  for
stocks with the higher liquidity, volume, volatility, and the lower B/M ratio. We estimate Fama-
Macbeth regressions as equations below:

Table 7 and 8 dually show the positive coefficient in stock’s characteristics of liquidity,
volatility, and volume. There is a positive relationship between liquidity and the downside risk
management  of TSL approach  except  when  20%  threshold  is  applied  in  Table  7. The TSL
approach is more effectively to reduce downside risks in excess of the BH approach for more
liquid stocks. The same positive relationship is hold for volume and volatility. They imply the
TSL approach  helps  to  reduce  downside  risks  for  stocks  with the  higher  trading  volume  and
volatility.  Furthermore,  our  results  indicate  a negative  association between  B/M  ratio  and

downside measures in both Table 7 and Table 8. This suggests the TSL approach performs well
at reducing downside risks for growth stocks.
On  the  other  hand,  even  though  both  VaR  and  ES  stand  for  downside  measures,  the
relationship between some cross-sectional determinants and the reduction in downside risks of
TSL approach is not consistent across Table 7 and 8. The price has a negative relationship with
the outperformance of the TSL approach in excess of the BH approach in controlling downside
risks regarding the most cases in Table 7. However, the association is changed to positive when
applying 1% or 5% thresholds in the Table 8. Moreover, the size in Table 7 has the negative
association with the effectiveness of TSL approach at reducing downside risks. But the results
in  Table  8 show a positive relationship between  size  and  the  downside  performance  except
when  applying  the  20%  threshold. Overall,  our  results  clearly  show  the TSL approach  is
effective  at  decreasing  downside  risks in  excess  of  the BH approach for  stocks  with
characteristics of higher liquidity, volume, volatility, and the lower B/M ratio.

## 4. Conclusions
Stop-loss rules are popular among participants in financial markets. Traditional stop-
loss  rules include  price-based  rules  (where  a  security  is  sold  when  the  price  drops  a  fixed
percentage below the purchase price) and time-based rules (where a security is only sold if the
pre-specified price decline occurs within a given time interval). Trailing stops, in contrast, are
more  flexible  as the  stop  price is adjusted  upwards  if  the  price  moves higher  following the
purchase.  A security is then sold when the price declines a pre-specified percentage below the
new high price.
We consider the performance of trailing stop-loss (TSL) rules in U.S. stocks compared
to a simple buy-and-hold (BH) approach for the 1926 – 2016 period. We account for the impact

of delisting returns as the trailing stop-loss rules may help to avoid the huge losses for delisted
stocks.
Our results indicate that TSL rules have lower returns than the BH approach. However,
they do a good job of stopping losses. They generate superior risk-adjusted returns for investors
with normal levels of risk aversion and perform particularly well at reducing downside risk, as
measured by VaRs and expected shortfalls. SL rules are particularly good at stopping losses
for stocks that end up delisting. They are becoming increasingly effective over time, perform
better when the overall market is declining and add more value on stocks with higher volatility,
and liquidity and lower book-to-market ratios.

Note: This table presents regression results on the difference between the TSL approach  and the BH
approach regarding three measurements, which are Certainty Equivalent Return (CER), Value-at-Risk
(VaR), as well as Expected shortfall (ES), in changing market states. We following Cooper, Gutierrez
Jr, & Hameed (2004) to determine the UP and DOWN market, based on monthly basis. 1%, 5%, 10%,
and  20%  thresholds  are applied to  the TSL approach.  The  coefficients  are  displayed  in  percent.  We
display P-value under each coefficient in the table.

Note: This  table indicates  how  cross-sectional  factors  affect  the  effectiveness  of  stop-loss  rules  in
reducing downside risks regarding 1% Value-at-Risk (VaR) by Fama-Macbeth regression. Six cross-
sectional  determinants,  which  are  size,  B/M  ratio, Amihud ratio,  volume,  price,  and  volatility,  are
studied  as  independent  variables  in  their  natural logarithm.  Each  variable  is in  monthly  basis. The
coefficients are displayed in percent. We display P-value under each coefficient in the table.

## Figure 1
Stop price movements (10% threshold applied)


Note: This figure shows different stop prices of each stop-loss rules. The price is set to 100 at the beginning. The stop price of trailing stop-loss rules is increased
only if the price is increased. The price based traditional stop-loss rules have a constant stop price over time. The time based traditional stop-loss rules have the
stop price based on the price at the beginning of previous 5 days.
